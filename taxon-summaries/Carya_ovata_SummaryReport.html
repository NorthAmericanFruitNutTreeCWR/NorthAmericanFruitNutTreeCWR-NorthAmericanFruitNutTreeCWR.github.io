In the meantime, if you would like to download and view the large version locally (~40 MB),<br>
  first download the HTML file <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aaWUfjso7kPUP0J4y-5oxCmQg15iUnx/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">here</a>,<br>
  then double click your <em>downloaded</em> copy and it should open in your default browser. Do not try to open in Google Drive

Thank you for your patience!
